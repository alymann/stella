**DIG3588C Project 1**

“Journey through a dreamlike landscape in search of the mythical Moonstone, an ancient artifact said to hold the power to restore balance to a fractured world. With the environment constantly transforming around her, Stella must solve environmental puzzles, befriend strange and whimsical creatures, and uncover forgotten stories hidden in the ruins of the past. Every step forward brings her closer to the Moonstone — and deeper into a mystery that blurs the line between reality and myth."
